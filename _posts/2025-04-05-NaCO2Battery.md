In 2018, scientists at the Department of Energy Engineering at the Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology in Korea developed a Sodium-Carbon Dioxide System that took CO2 and produced H2 and electricity. In order to do this, they used an Na ionic super conductor (NASICON) as a permeable membrane between the sodium metal used and the CO2, which was dissolved into water. At the time, NASICON required an investment of around $800 for 50 grams. To make this type of technology suitable for commercial use, the overall cost of a system like this would most likely have to decrease, and replaced with materials that were easier to aquire. Past research in other fields showed that ceramics (like terracotta used in plant pots), could successfully pass electrons as a membrane for a battery. This experiment focused on using this with the newer technology the scientists in Korea were using.

To start, I took a piece of speaker wire and wrapped it around a bolt. I then took graphite I extracted from pencils and super glued it to the contraption to create the anode. I chose graphite as research showed it preformed best in carbonated water, which represented the carbon dissolved into the water of the original project.

Sodium metal has been heavily researched as a replacement to lithium, conductivity is nearly equal, and it is 30 times cheaper than lithium. I mixed equal parts sodium trifluoromethanesulfonate into tetraethylene glycol dimethyl as an organic electrolyte (the same procedure used in the original experiment) and repeated the steps used for the graphite anode with sodium metal. Sodium metal reacts quickly with air, and with the limitations I had (no vaccum chamber), the sodium reacted quickly before I could place it into the electrolyte. This was a limiting factor in my experiment.

Next was testing, every 10 minutes I would record the change using an analog multimeter I purchased. Although the amount of current was small, it increased over time and it was clear a reaction was occurring. The graphite was showing the same reaction as seen in the original experiment, and the sodium metal ending up dissolving fully, also a sign of a reaction. My hyptothesis proved to be true and different ceramics could be used with the environmentally safe technologies being developed. Membranes are the usually the first part to go in a battery. However, certain ceramics can be "rebuilt" through recharging through methods like seawater electrolysis, which is a promising field that helps rebuild coral reefs. 

NOTES AND IMPROVEMENTS:
This was a fun project I built in high school for my AP Research paper senior year. However, due to my limited resources, I believe the system I built could be improved further. Better conductivity on the electrodes and a sterile lab environment for the sodium metal would have improved efficency greatly. Although more research is needed, cheaper and more accessible membranes for batteries is a promising field that could potiently further the development of eco-friendly battery solutions.
